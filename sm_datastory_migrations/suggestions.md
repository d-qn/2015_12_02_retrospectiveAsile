# 2015: la vague migratoire atteint l’Europe 

**TPT 18.2015 data story**


### General 


I would suggest for this 2015 retrospective data story to have a one tweet every 1 or 2 days from the publication date until the end of the year (so about 6 - 10 tweets). For Facebook, maybe less posts: 4-6

### Hashtags & mentions (for twitter)

Think to add the appropriate hashtags for this story on twitter.

Use at least one of these hashtags to tag it as a story about migrants/refugees: 
 
 * \#refugees, #migrant, #migrantcrisis, #asylum

Have at least one of these hashtags to tag it as data/graphics-driven story: 

* \#ddj, #dataviz

Furthermore on the 18th of December, it is the International migrants day. So you could also add this hashtag: 

* \#InternationalMigrantsDay


It would be a good idea to notify some of the data providers used for this story, we can do it by adding their twitter handle to the tweet. Maybe do this only once, we don’t want to spam people.

* @EU_eurostat (the main data provider used in this story)
* @refugees (UNCHR twitter)
